# Equlibrium Running FAQs

## Is this any different from "just running"?

Not really. And that's kind of the point.

Equilibrium Running is simply what a lot of people do instinctively, just written down. There's no secret workout, no proprietary structure, no claim that this is the right way to run.

The difference isn't the running. It's the mindset.

E-Running gives you the language and permission to adjust your goals without guilt, panic, or the feeling that you've failed the plan. It formalizes common sense and listening to your body as a skill, not a cop-out. If you're already doing that, congratulations! You've been E-Running the whole time.

## Is E-Running anti-structure or anti-discipline?

No. It's anti-rigidity.

Structure is useful. Discipline is useful. but they only work when they're in conversation with reality. E-Running doesn't remove structure, it softens the edges so structure can survive real life.

Skipping a run because you're exhausted isn't lack of discipline. Forcing a workout when you're depleted isn't toughness. Equilibrium is about choosing the option that keeps you training tomorrow, not just today.

## How does race training fit into this?
Very naturally. Races give direction. They don’t override balance.

In E-Running, race training is still:
- Running frequently
- Building toward a long run
- Including some faster running when possible
- Gradually increasing specificity as race day approaches

What changes is how strictly those elements are enforced. If life stress is high, training stress gets pulled back. If life is calm, training can expand. Missing a workout doesn’t trigger panic. It triggers assessment.

You still train for races. You can use whatever plan or structure you'd like. You just don’t sacrifice your health or your relationships for it.

## Can I follow a traditional training plan and still E-Run?

Absolutely. In fact, this is one of the best ways to use E-Running.

- The plan provides structure
- E-Running provides methodology

You can use any plan you like and apply E-Running as the decision-making layer on top. That might mean:
- Swapping hard days when life intervenes
- Turning a workout into an easy run
- Skipping a session without trying to “make it up”
- Extending a phase because your body needs more time

The plan stops being a contract and becomes a tool.

## Does E-Running mean I only run easy?
No, but it does mean easy running is foundational. Easy running builds durability, aerobic capacity, and mental sustainability. Faster running still matters, especially for racing, but it’s layered on when it fits rather than forced in because the calendar says so.

In practice, that often means:
- Easy runs make up the majority of mileage
- Faster runs happen when you’re rested enough to absorb them
- Speed is the first thing removed when stress rises, and the last thing added back

Intensity is valuable. Burnout is not.

## How do I know when to pull back?  
Equilibrium Running asks you to adjust training based on how your body and mind are responding. For me, journaling is one way to make those signals easier to notice over time. **Journaling is not a requirement.**

If you do keep a journal, entries can be as simple as:
- “5 km. Felt fine.”

Or as detailed as you want:
- Thoughts during the run
- How stress or sleep affected it
- What gear, fuel, or pace worked
- Emotional shifts that came up

Some days it’s logistics. Some days it’s reflection. Some days it’s just noting wildlife or unusual cars you saw. There’s no correct format. The value comes from consistency, not depth.

Even if you don't keep a journal, you should listen to the signals from your body. Did you have discomfort, did it go away? When did it go away? Are there a pair of shoes or socks that always seem to bother you? Did you accomplish your goals, or did you make adjustments? If you made adjustments, how and why?

Feedback, both mentally and physically, are inherent parts of E-Running.

## Is E-Running for beginners or experienced runners?
Both.

Beginners benefit from learning early that running doesn’t have to be all-or-nothing. Experienced runners often arrive at E-Running after discovering that fitness gained through suffering alone rarely lasts.

The philosophy scales with you. The balance point just moves.

## Does this work for [race distance]?

Yup. 5K, 10K, 10M, 13.1, full marathon. See some examples [here](./examples.md).
