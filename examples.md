# Equlibrium Running Examples

**Examples, not templates.** 

The following sample training outlines are not plans to follow.

They’re snapshots of how I applied Equilibrium Running to real training cycles, with real life constraints, across different distances and goals.

They show decisions, not prescriptions.

For the longer efforts (13.1, 26.2), I work to increase my long run by one mile per week. Every fourth week is a cutback (usually taking 2-3 miles off) to absorb the training. This means the start of my plan is dependent on how long it will take to increase to my longest planned long run distance.

The following examples show how Equilibrium Running has looked in practice for *me*. They reflect real constraints, imperfect weeks, and priorities outside of training.

## Half Marathon

I raced the Detroit International Half Marathon in October 2025, my second HM. I'd had surgery in April 2025 and had taken two months off of running. Through June I was mostly working on getting back to regularity.

**Base Phase: July**  
The priority was restoring frequency without chasing fitness.

3-4x weekday runs: 3-4 miles each  
1-2x weekly tempo runs as long as I was feeling good.  
Weekend long run: 5-7 miles

Raced a 5K as a baseline fitness check.

**Building Phase: August**  
Fitness returned naturally once consistency was re-established.

3-4x weekday runs: 3-4 miles each  
1-2x weekly tempo/threshold fartlek/strides. Switched to variable-distance speed as heat started to make fatigue less predictable.  
Weekend long run: 7-9 miles

Set a new 5K PR.

**Peak Phase: September-October**  
Durability mattered more than maximizing speed.

3-4x weekday runs: 3-4 miles each  
Occasional speed sessions. Summer heat and accumulated training fatigue meant speedwork was deprioritized to protect consistency.  
Long run: 10-12 miles

**Taper: October**  
The goal was freshness, not sharpness.

2-3 5km HM-pace runs  
Final long run: 6 mile progressive HM pace  
2 mile shakeout slow jog 2 days before race

### What I wish I had done differently

I wish I had incorporated more speed and race pace efforts, just to make the race more comfortable. However, recovering fitness from surgery took priority.

## Marathon

In October 2026 I will be racing the Chicago Marathon as my first full marathon. I will be starting from a baseline of around 25 miles per week (MPW).

This is my planned schedule, but of course it will change as needed to fit around my real life. As you can tell, the plan is not rigid, not highly structured, and mostly based around the long run as the most important run of the week.

The structure mirrors what worked in half marathon training: frequent easy runs, a graudally extending long run, and selective intensity when it fits.
